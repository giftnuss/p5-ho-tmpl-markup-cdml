Your last reply was [FMP-CurrentToken: HTML].
   <!-- After processing it could look like:

Up to nine tokens can be used by using a slightly different 
syntax for the 
token tags. The variable tag -Token can have an optional 
token specifier of the form -Token.X
where X can be the characters 0 through 9. If no period 
follows the -Token keyword then token
one is implied. To retrieve the value of a token the 
FMP_CurrentToken will accept another
parameter that is a number, of value 0 through 9. If 
there is no number parameter, but there
is a period, then token zero would be returned. CurrentToken 
constant for the FMP-If tag
would then have an optional specifier that would look 
like CurrentToken:3 if you want to
compare the contents of token three to something else.
Example format file snippet:
   <!-- Pass the value of token three onto the next request 
-->
   <INPUT TYPE="HIDDEN" NAME ="-Token.3" VALUE ="[FMP-CurrentToken: 
3]">
Tokens can be used on the right side of an FMP-If using 
the intratag replacement syntax:
[FMP-If: CurrentToken:5.eq.{CurrentToken:6}]
   <B>Token 5 equals token 6.</B>
[/FMP-If]

Field names are used to control find criteria or to 
upload data to a record. This is not a tag.
Usually the name portion of a name/value pair to be 
processed by FileMaker Pro is either a CDML action or 
variable tag. When a value for a specific field needs 
to be sent to FileMaker Pro, the name portion of the 
name/value pair is the name of a field in the FileMaker 
Pro database. Field names used in this manner should 
not start with the hyphen (-) character or contain any 
period (.) characters.
Name is
Name of the field in the database.
Value is
For the -New and -Edit tags, the value contains the 
data to be uploaded into a record. Multiple occurrences 
of a field allow the data to be put into separate repetitions 
of a repeating field.
For the -Find tag, the value is a find request on the 
specified field. 
For the -Img tag, the first field name in the URL is 
the name of the container field to retrieve the image 
from. The value portion is ignored.
For all other action tags, these name/value pairs are 
not needed.

=item [FMP-Header]

The HTTP header of the page sent to the browser is replaced

a browser to a different HTTP server instead of displaying 
the formatted page. Consult RFC 2068, Hypertext Transfer 
Protocol -- HTTP/1.1 for more information about HTTP 
headers.

spaces within text or number values.

=item -Token

Passes any value to a format file. Whatever value you 
set -Token equal to can be retrieved in the format file 
by using the [FMP-CurrentToken] tag, or it can be used 
in an [FMP-If] tag.
Value is
User defined.
Syntax example(s)

   <form action="FMPro" method="post">
   <input type="hidden" name="-DB" value="contacts.fp5">

   </form>
Continue to pass as token
   <input type="hidden" name="-Token" value="[FMP-CurrentToken]">
Specify a token using a link
   <a href="-DB=Contacts&-Format=format.html&-Token=The+Token&-View">Set 
a token</a>
Up to nine tokens can be used by using a slightly different 
syntax for the 
token tags. The variable tag -Token can have an optional 
token specifier of the form -Token.X
where X can be the characters 0 through 9. If no period 
follows the -Token keyword then token
one is implied. To retrieve the value of a token the 
FMP_CurrentToken will accept another
parameter that is a number, of value 0 through 9. If 
there is no number parameter, but there
is a period, then token zero would be returned. CurrentToken 
constant for the FMP-If tag
would then have an optional specifier that would look 
like CurrentToken:3 if you want to
compare the contents of token three to something else.
Example format file snippet:
   <!-- Pass the value of token three onto the next request 
-->
   <INPUT TYPE="HIDDEN" NAME ="-Token.3" VALUE ="[FMP-CurrentToken: 
3, HTML]">
Tokens can be used on the right side of an FMP-If using 
the intratag replacement syntax:
[FMP-If: CurrentToken:5.eq.{CurrentToken:6}]
   <B>Token 5 equals token 6.</B>

=item -Token

Passes any value to a format file. Whatever value you 
set -Token equal to can be retrieved in the format file 
by using the [FMP-CurrentToken] tag, or it can be used 
in an [FMP-If] tag.
Value is
User defined.
Syntax example(s)
Pass a record ID as a token using a form action
   <form action="FMPro" method="post">
   <input type="hidden" name="-DB" value="contacts.fp5">
   <input type="hidden" name="-Format" value="format.html">
   <input type="hidden" name="-Token" value="[FMP-CurrentRecID]">
   <input type="submit" name="-FindAll" value="Set a token">
   </form>
Continue to pass as token
   <input type="hidden" name="-Token" value="[FMP-CurrentToken]">
Specify a token using a link
   <a href="-DB=Contacts&-Format=format.html&-Token=The+Token&-View">Set 
a token</a>
Up to nine tokens can be used by using a slightly different 
syntax for the 
token tags. The variable tag -Token can have an optional 
token specifier of the form -Token.X
where X can be the characters 0 through 9. If no period 
follows the -Token keyword then token
one is implied. To retrieve the value of a token the 
FMP_CurrentToken will accept another
parameter that is a number, of value 0 through 9. If 
there is no number parameter, but there
is a period, then token zero would be returned. CurrentToken 
constant for the FMP-If tag
would then have an optional specifier that would look 
like CurrentToken:3 if you want to
compare the contents of token three to something else.
Example format file snippet:
   <!-- Pass the value of token three onto the next request 
-->
   <INPUT TYPE="HIDDEN" NAME ="-Token.3" VALUE ="[FMP-CurrentToken: 
3, HTML]">
Tokens can be used on the right side of an FMP-If using 
the intratag replacement syntax:
[FMP-If: CurrentToken:5.eq.{CurrentToken:6}]
   <B>Token 5 equals token 6.</B>
[/FMP-If]

-DB, -Format, any action tag
